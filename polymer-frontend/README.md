- user the Polymer library to ease component creation and reuse existing elements already designed
    + [Elements catalogue by Polymer](https://elements.polymer-project.org)
    + [Custom elements](https://customelements.io)
- user the offline enabled elements to get more of an app-like experience on any device

## Material Design

Use [Google's Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) approach for the Frontend providing a better integration across devices. 

Material design should enable us to provide a better integration across the devices a user might use to access Saltmine. It would also help to implement a component based model which could be reflected in the guidelines and documentation in Saltmine.

It would also present initial guidelines for providing accessibility.
